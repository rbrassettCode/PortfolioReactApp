      content: `First and foremost - welcome to my blog! I'm very excited to have you here. I'm not sure the direction of this blog but my goal is to demonstrate my skills as a developer and to share my thoughts on the world of software development.
        My main objectives for this blog are to:
        - Try new softwares and document my experiences with them. 
        - Share quick updates on my life and what's keeping me passionate.
        - HAVE FUN!
        

        This month, I've been working extremely hard on getting my react application open to the world (and if youre reading this then clearly I've succeeded). It's been challenging to maintain focus with all the distractions of summer activities and going out. I love the summer and it is definaltely the best time to try new things, be outside and enjoy life to its fullest. However, I've been trying to balance my time between work and play. I've been working on my application for about 2 months now and I'm very proud of the progress I've made. I've learned so much about react and javascript in general and hungry for more. I've also learned a lot about myself and how I work. I've learned that I work best when I'm in an environment with no distractions and my music blasting in my ears. I've recently been given a termination date for my job and now the time is ticking to get a new one. I'm not worried though, I know I'll find something that I love and that will help me grow as a developer. One thing I am looking forward to is not feeling guilty everytime that I take a break from searching job boards or improving my portfolio.
        
        
         Speaking of improving my portfolio, my portfolio page has been a great accomplishment for me. I designed it with the help of chatGPT and AWS Amplify for hosting. I find that chatGPT is a very helpful tool to leverage any time you can. Especially for ground up applications its great. I'm hoping to play around with AI technologies in future blog posts but for now I'll be sticking with my strengths as a web developer.
